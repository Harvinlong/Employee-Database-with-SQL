# Employee-Database-with-SQL
The goal of this project was to identify retirement-age employees and employees eligible for a mentorship program using SQL queries. To do this, I used the DISTINCT ON statement to create tables that contained the most recent title for each employee. I then used the COUNT() function to determine the number of retirement-age employees by most recent job title, and filtered the tables using WHERE clauses to include only employees within the appropriate age ranges. I also used a WHERE clause to exclude employees who had already left the company. By completing this analysis, I was able to provide a summary of the number of retirement-age employees and mentorship-eligible employees in the company, which will help prepare the company for the "silver tsunami" as many current employees reach retirement age.
